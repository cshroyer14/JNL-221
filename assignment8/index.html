<h2>PHILADELPHIA — The procession from starter to reliever to reliever to closer was sleek and streamlined, a model of efficiency, no time wasted, no quarter given. The <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/team/astros/">Houston Astros</a> responded to embarrassment in Game 3 of the World Series with history in a 5-0 victory in Game 4. Led by starter <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/cristian-javier-10CCaSHGL42KuvrA/">Cristian Javier</a>, a quartet of Houston pitchers combined for the first no-hitter in the World Series since Don Larsen twirled a perfect game for the <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/team/yankees/">Yankees</a> in the 1956.</h2>


<p>Sixty-six years had passed since Larsen’s feat. The Astros offered the public, and the <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/team/phillies/">Phillies</a>, a crash course in the maddening modern act of attempting to make solid contact with a baseball. Javier toyed with a lineup which had swatted five home runs the previous night. He held Philadelphia hitless and made them look helpless. He struck out nine across six innings. The only consolation for the Phillies was Houston had started three different pitchers before him.</p>

<p>Javier, 25-year-old right-hander with a slight frame and a deceptive fastball, performed with an ease that belied his age and his relative inexperience. Game 4 was only his third postseason start. It will be hard for him to top it. His bullpen made sure it would be remembered beyond Wednesday. The final three frames were manned by the relief trio of <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/bryan-abreu-B0zB53qmTS1jSqid/">Bryan Abreu</a>, <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/rafael-montero-adKQjp02RgJtEcYt/">Rafael Montero</a> and closer <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/ryan-pressly-TCpyU3DPZeRzrswV/">Ryan Pressly</a>. Abreu struck out the side in the seventh. Montero punched out a batter in the eighth.</p>


<p>In the ninth, Pressly worked around a walk to keep Philadelphia’s hit column blank. <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/alex-bregman-hYibtKvZwVQJJXhA/">Alex Bregman</a> scooped the final groundout and made a strong peg — sleek and streamlined, like the rest of Houston’s outfit — across the diamond. The Astros barreled out of the dugout and celebrated. The procession was brief. The achievement was great. There was still a World Series to win.</p>

<p>The no-no became official after the Astros offense had officially announced its arrival after 13 scoreless innings at Citizens Bank Park. The first nine empty frames on Tuesday put the Phillies ahead. The next four on Wednesday hinted at a collection of artillery pieces close to finding the range. When the Astros scored at last, in the fifth inning, the team unleashed a clinical, measured onslaught, mesmerizing with its precision and efficiency, that overwhelmed Philadelphia’s best pitcher, blew up the plans of Phillies manager Rob Thomson and evened the series at two victories apiece.</p>

<p>The constellation of Houston hitters starred as Phillies ace <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/aaron-nola-lR06mWlShqL9tUcb/">Aaron Nola</a> crumbled and bullpen fireman <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/jose-alvarado-zQxwyYXCnrkyUt0R/">Jose Alvarado</a> set the scene ablaze. Nola exited with the bases loaded and the game deadlocked. Alvarado permitted all three runners to score — and gave up two more of his own.</p>

<p>The Houston victory guaranteed this series will return to Minute Maid Park for a Game 6 on Saturday. In the interim, the final game in Philadelphia this season will pit Houston veteran <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/justin-verlander-oSSR8tLIfacQiNPd/">Justin Verlander</a> against Phillies pitcher Noah Syndegaard. Verlander coughed up a five-run lead in a Game 1 defeat. Syndergaard has not pitched since a six-batter outing on Oct. 22. The managerial mettle of both Thomson and Astros skipper Dusty Baker may well get tested.</p>

<p>Baker wore criticism for his inaction in Game 3. His bigger concern was the thunder emanating from the Phillies offense. The dingers lit up the ballpark for a night-long party. On occasion during Game 3, Baker looked out at the crowd.</p>

<blockquote>“I saw a bunch of red scarfs or towels or whatever, and it looked like they were having a good time,” Baker said in the afternoon before Game 4. He started to chuckle. “I would have been having a good time too if I was beating the other team and I was a fan of the Phillies, you know what I mean? So we’re going to try to stop so much of that partying tonight.”</blockquote>

<p>In Javier, the Phillies faced a pitcher capable of silencing most crowds and suppressing most lineups. Javier ranked 10th among pitchers with at least 140 innings in 2022 in ERA (2.54), third in strikeout rate (11.74 per nine innings) and sixth in batters permitted on base (0.95 walks plus hits per inning). He subdued most hitters with the stealthy movement of his fastball. The pitch operated as an optical illusion, with late explosion creating the impression of vertical rise.</p>

<p>But it was still a fastball. Which made it a favorable matchup for the Phillies. The heart of the team’s lineup feasts on heaters: <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/kyle-schwarber-XDAzbIEGKxz7Yb6H/">Kyle Schwarber</a> slugged .559 against fastballs in the regular season, and <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/rhys-hoskins-oo0aBA1OVAg0wJ9j/">Rhys Hoskins</a> slugged .502. <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/jt-realmuto-glotXhPPvld7bPpq/">J.T. Realmuto</a> (.688 slugging) and <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/bryce-harper-9lv6KXk96rZdbNPh/">Bryce Harper</a> (.637) were even more intimidating.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/lance-mccullers-jr-CmyzChNF4OmKeF9A/">Lance McCullers Jr.</a>, who served up all those homers in Game 3 while shying away from his fastball, Javier elected to attack the strength of Philadelphia’s lineup. After Schwarber flied out and Hoskins popped up, Javier fooled Realmuto with a slider for a 1-2-3 first inning.</p>

<p>The top five hitters in the Astros lineup had gone 1-for-18 on Tuesday. The group showed a little more life on Wednesday. Houston slugger <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/yordan-alvarez-O3WCvbbxvFoYfsTk/">Yordan Alvarez</a> hit a two-out single in the first. An inning later, outfielder <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/kyle-tucker-jqZDam8xs6T8T7g6/">Kyle Tucker</a> led off with a double. He had hounded Nola with a pair of homers in Game 1, but this time Nola kept him inside the park. In the process, he kept Houston off the board.</p>

<p>Tucker took third on a groundout by first baseman <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/yuli-gurriel-hi3wLyr6cbVxOImh/">Yuli Gurriel</a>. Nola recovered to exploit the feeble bottom third of Houston’s batting order. He fanned outfielders <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/aledmys-diaz-8vtHnbjDyWssEgjo/">Aledmys Díaz</a> and <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/aledmys-diaz-8vtHnbjDyWssEgjo/">Chas McCormick</a> to end the inning.</p>

<p>With Javier holding down the Phillies, the Astros made hard contact of Nola in the fourth. Nola picked up two outs that weren’t pretty: Third baseman Alex Bregman lined out to center and Tucker smoked a 108 mph liner into <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/nick-castellanos-fdWvKnNY31X4x4W1/">Nick Castellanos</a>’s glove in right. A pair of singles followed. Nola steadied himself with a curveball inside to Díaz. The light-hitting utility man tapped a grounder to shortstop <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/bryson-stott-hcCcZg6ozqzsltHw/">Bryson Stott</a>. Once more, Nola had escaped.</p>

<p>Nola could not afford to wobble. Javier refused to yield to the Phillies. His fourth inning might have been his best. Javier buzzed through Realmuto, Harper and Castellanos in 12 pitches. Javier spotted two sliders for strikes to Realmuto before rushing a 95 mph fastball past him. Harper could not catch up to three consecutive fastballs. And Castellanos had the same trouble with Javier’s signature pitch.</p>

<p>By the time Javier returned to the mound, Nola had imploded. The Astros strafed him in the fifth. McCormick started the flurry with a single. <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/jose-altuve-XBsBnmYpBnTfLi4H/">Jose Altuve</a> raked a single of his own. An irritating battle with rookie shortstop <a href="https://theathletic.com/mlb/player/jeremy-pena-xh1HFZyPsHgdGpSL/">Jeremy Peña</a> ensued. Nola buried Peña in an 0-2 count but could not finish the at-bat. His 67th and final pitch was a curveball over the middle. Peña ripped it into left field. The ball was hit so hard, 106.3 mph off the bat, that McCormick had to hold at third.</p>

<p>Thomson entered the fray. He trusted a strategy that had delivered his team this far. With Alvarez, a left-handed hitter, coming up, Thomson went with Alvarado, a lefty who had not permitted a run since the National League Division Series. The move made sense. It still did not work.</p>

<p>Alvarado required one pitch to make things worse. He drilled Alvarez in the ribs with a 99.2 mph fastball to break the scoreless deadlock. Bregman followed with an admirable piece of hitting. He fell behind, 0-2, before Alvarado tried a 100.7 mph sinker that tailed over the plate. Bregman drove the pitch to the opposite field, for a two-run double which splashed down inside the right-field line. These were the sharp, purposeful swings which had propelled the club all season. There were more to follow.</p>

<p>Tucker elevated a thigh-high sinker for a sacrifice fly. Gurriel, the veteran first baseman, capped the scoring by digging out a cutter near his ankles to single in the fifth run. The inning lacked the thunder which marked the Phillies output in Game 3. But it did the job, all the same. Once more, this series is tied. Javier and his crew made the defeat sting even more.</p>
