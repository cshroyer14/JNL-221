      <p>The Super Bowl. It is without a doubt the largest, most-watched championship in all of American professional sports. Children who play Pop Warner football dream of one day holding up the Lombardi Trophy. Listed as a football game, it is so much more than that. The second Sunday in February is essentially an unofficial holiday for society. It’s a day of partying with friends and eating an ungodly amount of food. A day of figuring out which company has the best commercial and how much they paid. A day of looking at your purchased “Super Bowl Boxes” and praying that the score you were given is correct. Even people who don't watch sports tune in, because that is the persona painted around it. It’s just one game, but to the 32 teams in the NFL, it is THE game. </p>

      <p>Every team puts their body on the line, week in week out, just with the hopes of playing in the Super Bowl. Society rallies around this one Sunday as a time to relax, enjoy company, and eat food. But for the players and coaches involved, this is everything they’ve ever worked for. So much more is involved than just going out and playing. I asked Kevin Cloghessey, head football coach of the Port Washington Vikings (Schreiber H.S.), how important it is to be surrounded with a good coaching staff and gameplan week to week. He said, “A good coaching staff is a very underrated aspect of any solid football team. To have a group of guys with a good IQ for the game and just bounce ideas off each other, iron sharpens iron. You can't gameplan with people who don't know what they'are talking about, it just doesn't work. Part of that falls on me too. It's my job to go out there and put together a team for my team.” He also spoke about how important it is to make connections with your players, adding “you're never going to be successful if your players don't want to play for you. I care for each one of my players on and off the field. I show them that I put in just as much work as they do. It's all about buying in. Teams who buy in are the ones who win championships.” Many NFL teams at the start of the season are allotted a hefty chance to hoist the Lombardi. However, few prevail throughout the rough, long seasons. Let’s take a look at the teams I believe truly have a chance win the big game: </p>

  <h2><b><u><i>NFC East Rivals</i></u></b></h2>

  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <h3><b>Philadelphia Eagles (11-1)</b></h3>
      <p>With what seems like a completely revamped team, the Eagles have established themselves as juggernauts in the NFL. Commanded by head coach Nick Sirianni and rolling third-year MVP candidate Jalen Hurts, the Birds have maintained their identity on the ground from years past, while also improving their arial attack by a near 30 yard average from 2021. Jalen Hurts has officially broken out, boasting a Pass TD-INT ratio of 20-3, nine rushing touchdowns, and a 108.3 passer rating. The draft day acquisition of A.J. Brown has also proven to be well worth its while. The physical receiver has shown he can make big plays, as well as drawing attention to open up the field for others to succeed. Being Hurts’ main target, he has hauled in 61 receptions for 950 yards and 9 scores. The defense has been one of the team's stories and is a large reason for their dominance. The additions of C.J. Gardner-Johnson (S), James Bradberry (CB), Hassan Reddick (LB), and Kyzir White (LB) have taken this promising group that has been built over the past few years, to a completely new level. That’s not even mentioning draft picks used on Georgia Bulldogs’ Jordan Davis (DT) and Nakobe Dean (MLB). They have one of, if not the best front 7 in all of football and depth that runs deeper than a white oak tree. They’ve allowed just under 19 points per game, and about 297 yards which is second best in the NFL. Although this team gets knocked for strength of schedule, they display week in and week out why they sit at the top. </p>

      <p><u><b>Non-QB MVP:</u></b> Offensive Line</p>
      <p>It is beyond easy to list Jalen Hurts as the MVP of this team looking at his current career year, but one unit of this team has got him to where he is. I am referring to the big boys in the middle: The Offensive Line. Last year, the Eagles offensive line finished the season ranking 5th according to Pro Football Focus. This year, they have taken the jump to number 1 and put on a beautiful display every week. RB Miles Sanders, who has never broken 900 rushing yards in a season, is on pace to be the Eagle’s first 1,000 yard rusher since LeSean McCoy in 2014. Hopefully that puts what they’re doing into perspective. Veterans Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson have yet to escape their generational All-Pro forms, constantly dominating in the run-block. But, one of the more impressive players has been Jordan Mailata, and the strides he has made during the past couple years. Coming from Australia as a rugby player, he has quickly turned into one of the best left tackles in the game.</p>

    <h3><b>Dallas Cowboys (9-3)</b></h3>
    <p>Having one of the more talented, star-studded teams in the NFL over recent years, the Dallas Cowboys sit just behind the Philadelphia Eagles at second in the NFC East. The injury to QB Dak Prescott in the first game of the season deterred many. But when all eyes turned to backup Cooper Rush, he was ready. Posting a 4-1 record with the one being to the Eagles, this can be great reassurance moving forward. But since the return of Prescott in week 7, the Cowboys offense has been nothing short of electric. They have a league-leading 42.4 touchdown drive percentage while putting up 37.2 points per game. Their 411 yards per game is also second most in the league. The running back tandem of Tony Pollard and Ezekiel Elliott have been very difficult to stop. While Zeke brings a wrecking-ball play style, Pollard, who has officially broken out, provides the fast big play ability that breaks down opposing fronts. However, with the bright lights shining on the offense, the defense has played very well under second-year Defensive Coordinator Dan Quinn. Incorporating the “Platoon System” on the line, the immeasurable depth and constant pressure allow the “Hot Boyz” to attack offensive lines quickly and ferociously. Although they are second in the league in pass-rush win rate at 53%, the lack of plugging the run game causes slight concern. In back to back games, the Packers and Bears put up at least 200 yards rushing on this defense. It’s something to look out for, but if someone can put the puzzle together, it is the ex-Legion-of-Boom coordinator.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p><b><u>Non-QB MVP:</u></b> Micah Parsons</p>
    <p>Parsons has not slowed down since having one of the best defensive rookie seasons we’ve ever seen. He is the co-frontronner with 49ers DE Nick Bosa to win the Defensive Player of the Year Award. The Cowboys LB is an absolute wrecking ball, forcing teams to completely gameplan for him. He is one person. Facing top 3 double team rate of 27%, he still wins an outrageous 26% of the time. He and Myles Garrett are the only two in the same category of numbers. This year, Micah has accumulated 52 tackles, 12 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 2 touchdowns, 3 passes defended, and shows no sign of slowing down. He is going to be a superstar for years to come.</p>

<h2><b><i><u>AFC Powerhouses</u></i></b></h2>

<br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8">
      <br>
      <h3><b>Buffalo Bills (9-3)</b></h3>
      <p>Sitting on top of the best division in the AFC, the Buffalo Bills are trying to get a shot at the big game and avenge their heartbreaking overtime loss last year to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional Round. Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs have been a culture shock for a team who has been rather quiet for the last part of a couple decades. Ranking top 3 in passing and top 8 in rushing, the Bills offensive can get it done in both facets. However, as good as Allen has been, his costly and timely interceptions have raised concern. He and Davis Mills of the Texans lead the league in INTs this year with 11. His losses against the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings have shown just that. He trusts his arm a little too much sometimes, trying to laser passes into extremely tough windows. Last year, Josh Allen was the most formidable player in his opponents’ redzone. This year, half of his picks have come from the 20 yard line and within. It is something to keep an eye on, but Allen is still a player who you want with the ball in his hands when it’s crunch time. The Bills defense has done their part holding their teams in games, even though they’ve surprisingly regressed from the 2021’s best unit, to 2022’s tenth best. They have allowed nearly 60 more yards per game, with 51 of them coming through the air. The lingering injury to Tre'davious White and Micah Hyde have proven to be cumbersome to this young group. But, McDermott and the front office can only be happy with the other strides they’ve made on defense: Von Miller. He continues to be a problem and demonstrates why he was such a sought after Free Agent.  Nonetheless, the Bills sit at 9-3 with impressive wins over Chiefs and Ravens as their playmakers aid to a solid brand of football. </p>

    <p><b><u>Non-QB MVP:</u></b> Von Miller</p>
    <p>The Bills brought in Miller to boost their defense just as the Rams did en route to their Super Bowl. His success has been imminent, posting a 23.7% pass-rush win rate which is a telling sign of his capability at this age. Although he only gets doubled 18% of the time, his presence has allowed fellow second-year pass-rusher Greg Rousseau to set a current career high in sacks (five). Although being just recently placed on IR due to a season-ending ACL injury, the former Super Bowl 50 made sure to make his mark.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p>Headed by who seems to be the face of the NFL, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are constantly on the brink of glory. In all 4 years with Mahomes as a starter, the Chiefs have made the AFC championship religiously, and the Super Bowl twice (winning one). With the departure of Tyreek Hill to Miami, many (and myself included) didn’t know what was in store for this team. Mahomes has taken that narrative and thrown it out the window. He leads the league in passing yards (3808), passing touchdowns (30), quarterback rating (78.5) and passing yards per game (317.3). He is the current odds-on favorite to win the NFL MVP at +125. He does an amazing job spreading the wealth, with every receiver having at least 200 yards, and three of them going over 580. His ultimate #1 target is, and has always been Travis Kelce. The mid-season switch at running back from Clyde Edwards-Helaire to Isiah Pacheco due to injury has also pumped new life into their ground game, making them a more versatile offense than they already were. Not to mention their defense, who has always been middle of the pack during the Mahomes era, is playing solid as the 16th best unit letting up 22.5 points and 343 yards a game. As a team that will most likely end on top of the AFC with a bye, the Chiefs have nothing to worry about as their precedence and recent play continue to show their capability.</p>

      <p><b><u>Non-QB MVP:</u></b> Travis Kelce</p>
      <p>Kelce is one of, if not the greatest tight end of all time (minus the run-blocking). A 7-time Pro Bowler and 3-time All-ProThis year, he’s on pace to have over 100 receptions, 1200 yards, and 15 touchdowns. He holds the record for most consecutive 1,000 yard seasons by a TE (6), and shows no signs of slowing down. With the fairly new and different group of receivers placed around him, Mahomes has continued to count on him time and time again and Kelce has rarely, if ever wavered.</p>

      <h3><b>San Francisco 49ers</b></h3>
      <p>Similar to the Bengals, the 49ers started rough at 3-4 and hit their stride as they’re on a 5 game heater. The switch between Trey Lance back to Jimmy Garappalo due to injury had been paying dividends for a typically playoff-bound team. However, with Garappolo’s recent season ending injury, the weight has fallen on the shoulders of Brock Purdy (former Mr. Irrelevant). In his first NFL action, Purdy entered the game and executed flawlessly. He did not seem afraid of the moment, and showed he could do more than just pass. There are still some concerns on how sustainable this offense can be. The deadline transaction to acquire Christian McCaffery from the Panthers has been absolutely blockbuster. But what will the implications be of fixing an injury-ridden backfield, with an injury-ridden star? Nonetheless, the 49ers defense has been the story of the Kyle Shanahan era. They are currently the number 1 ranked defense holding opponents to a league-leading 15.8 points per game and 283.9 total yards. Demeco Ryans, the defensive coordinator who is expected to become a head coach next year, thrives using the “Platoon System'' which thrives off the “next man up” mentality. They are constantly flying to the ball and allow their opponent minimal red-zone opportunities.</p>

Leading the league with 14.5 sacks, he also deals with a 22% double team rate that ranks top 10 in the NFL. Bosa has also recorded 64 total pressures and wins on 23.3% of his pass-rush snaps, which totals second in the league amongst qualified defenders. His value increases with plays that are not listed on the stat sheet, creating favorable matchups for a very deep San Francisco line.

    <p>After a rocky start of 4-4, the Joe Burrow led Cincinnati Bengals have hit their stride with 4 straight wins. Although they boast the 4th best passing and 26th best rushing offense, the return of Ja’Marr Chase and explosion of backup running back Samaje Perine have put everyone back on notice. In 3 games with starting RB Joe Mixon out, Perine has had 49 carries for 194 yards, 14 receptions for 136 yards and 4 total touchdowns. If coach Zac Taylor can efficiently utilize a 1-2 punch with their other weapons, the ceiling for this team is the sky. The newly revamped offensive line has put up average numbers through 13 weeks, allowing Burrow to be sacked 34 times. But, this is still astronomically better than 2021 as they allowed him to be sacked 70 times. Yes, 7-0. Their defense currently sits at the 12th best unit, but they have a knack for getting off the field. They rank 2nd in plays run against them, and the secondary has allowed the 2nd lowest completion rate in the league. Sitting at second in the AFC North, there is an extremely good chance they will finish the season in first. The Ravens are a well rounded team, but have shown their complacency when finishing games.</p>

      <p>Although the defense has played well as a unit, Trey Hendrickson has lived up to his title of 2021’s number 1 disruptor. With 28 tackles, he is on pace to set a career high, as well as ranking top 5 in QB pressures with 33. Since signing in 2020, Hendrickson has done wonders for this defense. His constant pressure draws attention from the opposing line, allowing his counterparts of Sam Hubbard and D.J. Reader to have an easier matchup. It also allows the 4-3 defense to only rush the line, while the linebackers drop into coverage. He has been well worth his 4-year $60 million extension.</p>
